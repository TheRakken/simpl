simpl is a "Security IMplied Password Locker"

As stated, simpl is a password locker. The idea behind it is a small, lightweight, but secure, password locker.

simpl has not been audited; therefore, you are admonished to use at your own risk. It has been developed with the best cryptographic libraries available for Python and any security issues brought to my attention will be taken care of ASAP.

In regards to not being audited, I welcome anyone to audit it, if they wish. Until a proper audit has been performed, it is in your best interest to not rely on the security of this software and treat it as potentially insecure. 

I have developed simpl to learn more about cryptography and its practical applications.

If you want to contribute, please keep in mind that your additions must stay within the realm of "Simple and Lightweight".
